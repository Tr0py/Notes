If you want to quickly open an application in Mac, you can use Spotlight
(Command + Space) and type its name, or part of its name.  Eg. `chr` --> Chrome,
`wc` --> WeChat.

However, Notion has a prefix collision with Notes: Your have to type `noti` and
`note` to distinguish them.  You'll need a total of 5 keystrikes to invode
Notion!  That's too many.

In this case, simply rename your Notion in `/Applications` folder to `NT` or `No
tion`.  Then you can use `nt` in spotlight to invoke Notion way more faster.

This solution also applies to other applications.
